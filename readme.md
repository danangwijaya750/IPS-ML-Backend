# Flask Backend for Deep Learning Model Deployment

This repository contains the code for deploying a deep learning model using Flask as a backend. The project aims to serve as a foundation for deploying deep learning models through web services API.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following components:

- Flask application for serving the model
- Deep learning model (replace with the name and details of your model)
- Model preprocessing and post-processing scripts
- Docker setup for containerization (if applicable)

## Getting Started
